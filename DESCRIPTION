Description: A small collection of interesting and educational machine
    learning data sets which are used as examples in the 'mlr3' book
    (<https://mlr3book.mlr-org.com>), the use case gallery
    (<https://mlr3gallery.mlr-org.com>), or in other examples. All data
    sets are properly preprocessed and ready to be analyzed by most
    machine learning algorithms.  Data sets are automatically added to the
    dictionary of tasks if 'mlr3' is loaded.
